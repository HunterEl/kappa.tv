# Kappa view
A new User Interface for Twitch.tv

![Kripp demo](http://github.com/ranneyd/kappaview/kripp.png)

I'll keep this brief. Kappa View is a new way to experience Twitch.tv. It makes the stream full screen and has chat on top of it. Chat is draggable, resizable, and see through. Everytime you play with the chat window the data is saved as a cookie so the next time you open the page, your settings are automatically applied. These settings are channel-specific so you can have different settings for different streams.

Example: If you watch <a href="twitch.tv/nl_kripp">nl_kripp</a> play hearthstone on twitch you know he puts his face in the lower left hand corner and has his deck tracker on the right side. The left side of the screen above his face, however, is dead space. You can put Twitch chat over this area, make it go from the left edge to the play-history column in the game and have it go from the top of the stream down to Kripp's face. The next time you visit Kripp's stream, these settings will be automatically saved since you know he always plays the same Casualstone every night.

To use Kappa View, just download all the files just as they are, then open index.html in any browser*. If you download it as a zip, make sure you extract all the files before you open it.

If you have suggestions or ideas, report them as issues or, even better, fork this, edit it, and make a pull request. Please fork this and contribute if you like the idea and want to make it better!

*I've only tested it in Google Chrome. It should work in all modern browsers.
